## Files

In Stroboscopic.py the functions are defined, that are then used in the script_main-py.  

## Remark

I developed this code in a first step, then I decided to organize it using classes and I personally recommend that version, available in this same repository. I nevertheless keep this version since it is the one used for the developing of the project.
