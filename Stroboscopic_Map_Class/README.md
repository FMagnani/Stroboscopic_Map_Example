## Files

system.py contains the "system" class definition, main.py contains a script with the example of a typical usage I employed.

## Usage

I used to set all the parameters at the beginning. For different simulations I used to change someone of them and re-run the script.  
The usage of the "system" class is simple:  
1- Initialize the system. The script does it automatically using the parameters I set at the beginning.  
2- Evolve the system with one of the two methods "apply_Map_Time" or "apply_Map_Theta".  
3- Plot the evolved orbits on the plane or in a 3D space using the methods "Plot_2D" or Plot_3D".
